Description
===========

These are simple BPM abstractions for Animation node addon and Sverchok addon in Blender

Usage
=====

Simply enter the same FPS value than your blender project in the FPS node and choose which BPM you want to use
you can then use the values comming from the "beat" and "bar" nodes in your project or create your own tempo divisions, in this case one "bar" is four "beats"

you can either append the nodetrees from the blend file or create node groups or in the case of sverchok import the .json directly in a new nodetree.
